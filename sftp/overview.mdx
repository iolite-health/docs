---

Customers upload files via SFTP. Each customer gets a dedicated folder structure backed by cloud storage. When files land, they are automatically parsed and converted into entities in our data engine.

## Infrastructure

Our SFTP system provides:

- **SFTP server** — Secure file upload endpoint for customers
- **Cloud storage** — Three buckets per tenant:
  - **Ingestion** — Files land here from SFTP
  - **Processed** — Successfully parsed files are archived here
  - **Invalid** — Files that failed validation (triage queue)
- **File processor** — Parses files and writes entities to our data engine

## Customer folder structure

Each customer gets a set of default folders on the SFTP server:

```
/{customer-slug}/
├── EDI/              # 837 claims and 835 remittances
├── UCRN/             # Account-to-claim crosswalk files
├── MedicalRecords/   # Supporting medical documentation
├── Contracts/        # Payer contract documents
└── Supplemental/     # Additional files
```

<Note>
  The folder name determines how files are parsed. A file in the `EDI/` folder is parsed as X12 EDI. A file in `UCRN/` is parsed as a pipe-delimited crosswalk.
</Note>

## Processing pipeline

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload">
    Customer uploads a file via SFTP. It lands in the ingestion bucket.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validate">
    The file processor validates the path format: `{customerSlug}/{fileCategory}/{filename}`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Route & parse">
    Based on the folder:
    - **EDI/** — X12 parser creates Claim and Remit entities
    - **UCRN/** — CSV parser creates Account entities and links to Claims
    - **MedicalRecords/** — Associates documents with existing Claims
  </Step>
  <Step title="Persist">
    Entities are created or updated in our data engine via the API.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Archive">
    The file is moved to the Processed bucket (or Invalid if parsing failed).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What happens next

Once files are parsed into entities, our **background services** pick up the changes in real time to:

- Parse raw EDI data into structured Claim and Remit entities
- Create Account entities from UCRN crosswalks and link claims
- Link remittance payments to their corresponding claims
- Associate medical records with patient claims
