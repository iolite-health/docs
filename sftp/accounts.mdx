An **Account** is the primary organizational unit in our platform. It represents a patient billing account at a healthcare facility and serves as the container that groups together all related claims, payments, medical records, and work queue items.

## What is an Account?

In our entity model, an Account is simply an entity with an `Account` component:

```json
{
  "id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
  "Account": {
    "name": "67890"
  },
  "Customer": {
    "slug": "hospital-xyz"
  }
}
```

The `Account` component is minimal by design — just a name (typically the account number). Rich context comes from **child entities** linked to the account and **additional components** attached to it.

## Related components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `Account` | Core identifier — the account number/name |
| `Customer` | Which customer this account belongs to |
| `AccountStatus` | Work status: workstream, invoice status, narrative |
| `AccountDocument` | Supporting documents (contracts, medical records) |
| `Activity` | Work queue entries — appeals, outreach, follow-ups |

## Account hierarchy

An Account groups related entities as children:

- **Account 67890**
  - Claim 1
    - ServiceLine A
    - ServiceLine B
  - Claim 2
    - ServiceLine C
  - Remit 1
    - ServiceLine D
  - MedicalRecord 1

These parent-child relationships are stored as **entity edges** and can be traversed in both directions.

## How Accounts are created

Accounts enter the system through several paths:

### 1. UCRN files (most common)

Our [account creation service](/sftp/ucrn) creates Accounts from UCRN crosswalk files. Each row in a UCRN file maps an account number to a claim number. The service creates the Account entity and links the matching claims as children.

### 2. Customer-specific logic

Some customers have custom account creation rules. For example, one customer derives account numbers from the first 7 characters of the claim submitter ID. These rules are implemented per-customer in dedicated services.

### 3. Medical records

Our medical record service may create accounts when processing medical record files, matching by patient identifiers found in the filename or document metadata.

## Workstreams

Accounts are organized into workstreams based on the type of RCM work being performed:

| Workstream | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `UnderpaymentsReview` | Claims that were paid below expected amounts |
| `DenialManagement` | Claims that were denied by the payer |
| `RevenueIntegrity` | General revenue cycle work |
| `PrebillReview` | Pre-submission claim review |
| `None` | No active workstream assigned |

The workstream is stored in the `AccountStatus` component and determines which queue the account appears in for users in our UI.

## Account lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Created">
    Account entity is created from a UCRN file, customer-specific logic, or medical record processing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claims linked">
    Claims are associated as children of the Account via entity edges.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Remits arrive">
    As 835 EDI files are processed, remittance payments are linked to the matching claims.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Work queue">
    The Account appears in the appropriate workstream queue based on its `AccountStatus`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="User review">
    A user reviews the account in our UI — files appeals, conducts outreach, or resolves the case.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Each step creates an immutable checkpoint, providing a full audit trail of every change to the account and its children.
