UCRN (Universal Claim Record Number) is a crosswalk file format that maps **patient account numbers** to **claim numbers**. This is necessary because healthcare claims often don't contain the account number used by the provider's billing system.

## The problem UCRN solves

When a hospital submits claims electronically (via 837 EDI), the claim is identified by a **claim number** (submitter ID). But the hospital's internal billing system tracks patients by **account number**. These are often different identifiers.

Later, when a payer sends back a remittance (835 EDI), it references the **claim number**. To reconcile the payment back to the patient's account, you need a mapping between the two.

| System | Identifier | Example |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Hospital billing | Account Number | `67890` |
| Submitted claim (837) | Claim Number | `12345` |
| Payer remittance (835) | Claim Number | `12345` |
| **UCRN file** | **Maps Account → Claim** | **`67890` → `12345`** |

Without UCRN, there's no way to connect the dots.

## File format

UCRN files are **pipe-delimited CSVs** uploaded to the `UCRN/` SFTP folder.

Required fields:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Facility ID | Identifier for the healthcare facility | `FAC001` |
| Account Number | The provider's internal billing account number | `67890` |
| Claim Number | The claim submitter ID from the 837 EDI | `12345` |
| Service Category | `I` (Inpatient) or `O` (Outpatient) | `I` |
| Pull Date | Date the crosswalk was generated | `2026-02-19` |

Example file:
```
FAC001|67890|12345|I|2026-02-19
FAC001|67891|12346|O|2026-02-19
FAC001|67892|12347|I|2026-02-19
```

## How UCRN is processed

<Steps>
  <Step title="File ingestion">
    Our file processor reads the pipe-delimited file and creates an entity for each row with the UCRN data and customer identifier.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Background service picks it up">
    Our account creation service subscribes to entities with UCRN data and processes them in batches.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Account lookup or creation">
    For each UCRN entry, the service:
    1. Searches for an existing Account entity by account number
    2. If none exists, creates a new Account entity with the customer's slug
    3. Searches for existing Claim entities by the claim submitter ID
  </Step>
  <Step title="Linking">
    The service links Claims to Accounts via **entity edges** (parent-child relationships). This creates the association that allows the platform to group all claims under a patient account.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Result

After UCRN processing, Claims are linked as children of the Account:

- **Account 67890**
  - Claim 12345 — linked by UCRN
  - Claim 12346 — linked by UCRN
  - Claim 12347 — linked by UCRN

When remittance payments arrive later (via 835 EDI), our remittance association service can trace from the remittance's claim number back to the Account through these links.

## Customer-specific behavior

Different customers may have different account creation logic:

- **Standard UCRN**: Account number comes directly from the UCRN file
- **Custom logic**: Some customers derive account numbers from claim data (e.g., first 7 characters of the claim submitter ID)

Each service is configured per-customer to handle these variations.
